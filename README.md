## ‚ùî What is Valorant Utils?

Valorant Utils is an Overwolf app that works only for Valorant. For now app can only show our game map, mode, agent and score as Discord Status (Discord Rich Presence) but there's also a plan to add more functions/tools.

## ‚ùî How it works?

The app is using overwolf API to get Valorant informations about our match, the data is processed and send to discord by a [Plugin](https://github.com/overwolf/overwolf-plugins/tree/master/sample_apps/discord-rich-presence)

## ‚ùî How to use?

To use this app you need to download it from the Overwolf Appstore (SOON)

## üîß Settings

To open settings press Alt + B (Default, set this to your preferences in Overwolf Settings),
for now there are only options to:
- Enable/Disable Discord Rich Presence
- Enable/Disable Agent display
